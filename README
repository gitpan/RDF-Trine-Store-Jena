NAME
    RDF::Trine::Store::Jena::SDB::Layout2::Hash - connect to Jena SDB stores
    in layout2 hash format

DESCRIPTION
    This module inherits from RDF::Trine::Store so provides the constructors
    and methods described there. It also provides a method "init" analogous
    to that from RDF::Trine::Store::DBI which creates the table structures
    and indexes in a blank database.

    This should theoretically work on any reasonably SQL-compliant database
    supported by DBI. Tested:

    *   PostgreSQL - works

    *   SQLite - "get_statements" fails
